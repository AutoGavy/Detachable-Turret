# Detachable Turrets Server Plugin for Alien Swarm Reactive Drop
We know that sentry turrets can be detached in Halo series. So why RD can't?


- How to enable this plugin:

  put

  cl_mapspawn_nut_exec 1

  sv_mapspawn_nut_exec 1

  into your console, or autoexec.cfg

  *Then equip any sentrygun in your first slot, you will get a detached turret! <<<<

  Once it drops to the ground, it will automatically turns into an unpickable static sentrygun


- Cannot work with "TickRate Doors\Lifts Fix" addon (using the same file)

  Plugin only works for server or room host


- If you want to disable, just set them back:

  cl_mapspawn_nut_exec 0

  sv_mapspawn_nut_exec 0

  *Remember to set back if you want to disable
